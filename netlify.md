  # This is where we will look for package.json/.nvmrc/etc.
  base = "/"

  # Directory (relative to root of your repo) that contains the deploy-ready 
  # HTML files and assets generated by the build. If a base directory has
  # been specified, include it in the publish directory path.
  publish = "build/"

  # Default build command.
  command = "npm run build"

[build.environment]
